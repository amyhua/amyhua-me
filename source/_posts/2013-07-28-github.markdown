**Publish your Octopress / Jekyll blogs, or just edit and deploy your Github from the cloud.**

If you use a self-hosted blogging website generator like Octopress/Jekyll,
making a post on your blog can get tedious: first, you have to use rake
to generate a new blog post, `rake new_post["<title>"]`; then you push
your newly written blog post from your local repo to Github; then deploy
it to Heroku. This can seem like quite a bit of work if you're just trying
to publish blog posts on the fly, and it makes it practically impossible
to publish blog posts from your mobile device. All the sudden, you start to
wonder why you didn't use something more convenient and mobile like Blogger
or Tumblr. Then you remember it's because *you're a badass*, and something
like Tumblr just won't be able to handle that.

But fear no more! If you use Github and deploy with Heroku,
you can use [Prose](www.prose.io) and [Github Heroku Pusher](https://github.com/ajlai/github-heroku-pusher)
together to publish your blog posts and pages from the cloud, as long
as you can also access your command line remotely by enabling SSH on your Mac or PC.

Enabling SSH allows you to remotely access the command line interface of your computer
so that you can run commands like `rake generate` on your Jekyll blog from afar.
MacLife offers an [excellent tutorial](http://www.maclife.com/article/howtos/how_enable_ssh_your_mac)
on enabling SSH on your Mac. HongKiat.com has a useful guide on
[How to Remotely Access Mac from your Tablet](http://www.hongkiat.com/blog/remote-access-mac-from-ios-android-tablets/),
and Forbes Magazine also published a [great article examing different iPad/iPhone apps
you can use to access your Mac or PC remotely](http://www.forbes.com/sites/adriankingsleyhughes/2012/11/11/can-i-access-my-macpc-remotely-from-my-iphoneipadipad-mini/).
It is easy and anybody can do it.

**Prose** allows you to edit your remote Github repos without ever
leaving the browser, while **Github Heroku Pusher** pushes the latest
commit on your github repo to Heroku.

Combined, they allow easy
on-the-fly blogging for your Octopress/Jekyll, etc. powered websites from the cloud,
as well as in-the-cloud editing of your Github repos in general.


No local repo required.


###A warning about potential merge conflicts:

With this setup, it's easy to neglect to pull from your remote repo
(aka your "origin" /repo on Github) first before trying to make
changes on your local. Then all the sudden when you try to push
your local repo to your remote after doing a few edits, you end
up with a merge conflict and have to do a manual merge of the two
branches, which can be tedious. Remember to **always first pull
the latest edits from your remote to your local before making
changes to your local repo** to avoid the potential mess.
